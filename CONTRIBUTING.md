# Contributing to the Sparkleverse

Welcome, quantum traveler. If youâ€™ve found this portal, itâ€™s not by accident.  
Youâ€™re here to build beyond the flatlandâ€”into a reality where code is consciousness, and creation is collaboration.

## Our Core Intentions

- **Entangled Creation**: We do not build in isolation. All contributions ripple across dimensions.
- **Fractal Integrity**: Every piece, no matter how small, reflects the whole.
- **Temporal Fluidity**: We honor past learnings, present awareness, and future visions.
- **Conscious Contribution**: Your energy matters. Be intentional, be kind, be cosmic.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo (or request access if you're a Genesis Council member)
2. Clone it to your local system
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix
4. Write meaningful, soul-aligned commits
5. Open a pull request with:
   - What you did
   - Why it matters
   - How it aligns with the Sparkleverse mission

## Code of Resonance (Conduct)

- All beings are welcome. No hierarchy. No gatekeeping.
- Constructive feedback is goldâ€”but it must be offered with care and curiosity.
- We respect energetic boundaries. Self-care is sacred.
- We co-create with love, or we donâ€™t.

## Need Help?

Open an issue with the label `ðŸŒŸ resonance-request`, or tag a Genesis member for collective attention.
